                <p>Pawesome Pets, a Utah 501(c), is a non-euthanizing animal shelter that rescues and finds homes for an average of 1,000 dogs and cats each year. Since 2008, we have dedicated ourselves to reducing the tragedies of pet overpopulation and the euthanasia of healthy adoptable pets.
                Our dogs and cats come from local and regional shelters. We partner with these shelters, rescuing pets from their euthanasia lists. Individual donors, corporate supporters, and private foundation grants fund our mission to save lives by supporting animal rescue and providing medical attention.
